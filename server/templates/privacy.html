            nor affiliated with Telegram. The Developer is the person or entity defined as such, for example within the
            Terms of Service of the DanVPN Bot, its interfaces, or in its response to the
            <code>/developer_info</code> command.
        </p>
        <p>3.2. You understand and agree that, without limiting section 8, this Policy may be amended at any time,

                href="https://telegram.org/tos/bots" class="text-link">Bot Terms</a> and the Telegram <a

            limitation age restrictions and third-party store terms.</p>
        <p>3.5. The Developer operates under the understanding that all information you provide is submitted in good
            faith, and is not obligated to check or verify your statements for errors or inaccuracies. It is your
            responsibility to ensure that all information you provide is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
        <p>3.6. You may decide to make some information available in the public domain, either directly on the Platform,
            elsewhere on the internet, or via the DanVPN Bot. The information you choose to make public may be
            accessed by other users of the DanVPN Bot via the Platform or on the internet, in which case it
            will not be covered or protected by this Policy.</p>

        <h4><a class="anchor" name="4-collection-of-personal-data" href="/vpn/privacy#4-collection-of-personal-data"><i
                    class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Collection of Personal Data</h4>

                class="text-link">Telegram
                Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/tos/mini-apps#4-privacy" class="text-link">Mini App
                Terms</a>.</p>
        <p>4.2. Without limiting <a href="/vpn/privacy#4-collection-of-personal-data" class="text-link">section
                4.1.</a>,

            files to it, or choose to share personal information such as your contact or phone number.</p>

        <p>5.1. The DanVPN Bot only requests, collects, processes, and stores data that is necessary for its
            designated features to function properly. The DanVPN Bot processes your personal data on the legal
            ground that such processing is necessary to further its legitimate interests, including <br>(i) providing
            services to its users; <br>(ii) detecting and addressing security issues in respect of its provision of
            services; <br>unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that
            require protections of personal data.</p>
        <p>5.2. The Developer does not monetize or otherwise utilize user data for applications outside the scope of
            the DanVPN Bot, unless otherwise clearly stated by the Developer and explicitly agreed to by the
            User.</p>
        <p>5.3. Without limiting <a href="/vpn/privacy#6-data-protection" class="text-link">section 6.2.</a>, private

            to any third party, except as stipulated by this Policy and agreed to by the User.</p>
        <p>5.4. In any event, the Developer will only collect or otherwise aggregate user data in compliance with
            applicable laws, third-party store terms, and for no other purposes than those clearly stated in this Policy
            and necessary to furnish and enhance the functionality of the DanVPN Bot.</p>

            distribution.</p>
        <p>6.2. The Developer will never share user data with third parties, including with the Developer’s own
            additional
            services or bots (if any, as the case may be) unless explicitly authorized by the User or required by law,
            such as in response to a lawful court order.</p>

        <h4><a class="anchor" name="7-rights-and-obligations" href="#7-rights-and-obligations"><i
                    class="anchor-icon"></i></a>7.

            deletion of all personal data the DanVPN Bot collected and stored in connection with them, with the
